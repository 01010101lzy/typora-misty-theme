# Misty Theme

Yet another `subtle`,`elegant` & `unobstructive` theme aimed at the philosophy of `simplicity`, `aesthetic` and `readability`, for the awesome [Typora](https://typora.io/) markdown editor and reader.

Tweaked for both English🇺🇸 & 中文🇨🇳. Works on both macOS & Windows.

Ships with **Light** 🌞 & **Dark** 🌑 color schemes. [Download](https://github.com/etigerstudio/typora-misty-theme/releases/latest)

## Installation

[Download theme stylesheets](https://github.com/etigerstudio/typora-misty-theme/releases/latest) of the platform you work on and color schemes you like. Copy it into the themes folder of Typora. Select theme name (eg. `Misty Light Macos`) form the theme list to apply it. You may restart Typora once to help it discover and load the theme file, if it cannot be found in the theme list.

## Compatibility

Misty is both test on `macOS 10.13.6` and `Windows 10 version 1703`. However, it has not been tested on `Linux` thoroughly yet and will be tested in future. 

Font fallback list is tweaked for both English and Chinese, on both macOS and Windows. Font weight values have been slightly adjusted on Windows to match Windows-specific rendering characteristic.
