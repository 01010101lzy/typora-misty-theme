# Misty Theme

Yet another `subtle`,`elegant` & `unobstructive` theme aimed at the philosophy of simplicity, aesthetic and readability, for the awesome [Typora](https://typora.io/) markdown editor and reader.

Tweaked for both Englishüá∫üá∏ & ‰∏≠Êñáüá®üá≥. Works on both macOS & Windows.

## Rendering demo

The above screenshot is a demo for all the styles provided in the Misty Theme, meaning that rendering of all other built-in features of Typora (such as lists, math blocks, etc.) is kept untouched and is supposed to work in default behaviors.

## Installation

Download misty-theme.css and copy it into the themes folder of Typora. Select 'Misty Theme' form the theme list. A restart might be needed for discovering and loading the theme file, if the theme list does not contain it.

## Compatibility

This theme is both test on macOS 10.13.6 and Windows 10 version 1703.

Font fallback list is tweaked for both English and Chinese, on both macOS and Windows, while font rendering on macOS is *slightly more comfortable* than that on Windows currently. This platform-specific issue will be thoroughly tested and addressed at future versions.
