Ships with **Light** 🌞 & **Dark** 🌑 color schemes. [Download](https://github.com/etigerstudio/typora-misty-theme/releases/latest)

## Compatibility

Misty is both test on `macOS 10.13.6` and `Windows 10 version 1703`. However, it has not been tested on `Linux` thoroughly yet and will be tested in future. 

Font fallback list is tweaked for both English and Chinese, on both macOS and Windows. Font weight values have been slightly adjusted on Windows to match Windows-specific rendering characteristic.

## Pending Works
